                    Padel it's a mix between tennis and squash: you have to play the ball over the
                    net and you are allowed to use the walls that surround the court. It's the fastest
                    growing sport in the world, played by people of all ages and many famous athletes
                    .The secret of its success: it’s simple and fun.
                    Padel is a sport that is mostly played 2 vs 2.
                    The scoring system is the same as in tennis. A padel court is 10×20 m, which is smaller
                    than a tennis court, and it's surrounded by walls and fences with a surface made of
                    artificial grass and sand. The balls used in padel are similar to tennis balls,
                    but softer, and you play with a specific racket that has a hard surface and holes.
                    You can quickly enjoy playing padel without having great technical skills.
                    EVERYONE can play padel - it's easy to learn and it' s a sport for all ages.

                    The first padel court was created by Enrique Corquera in the late 1960s.
                    He wanted to build a tennis court in his house, but since the space was
                    limited for a traditional tennis court, he decided to use a small area
                    surrounded by walls and metal fences.
                    Corcuera invited a Spanish friend, the nobleman Alfonso Hohenloe,
                    to play padel at his home, and he liked it so much that when he returned
                    to Marbella in 1974 he decided to build a padel court in his sports centre,
                    the Marbella Club. It was there that some Argentinian athletes discovered
                    it and decided to import this new game to Argentina, where in just a few
                    years padel became a sport played by millions of people.
                    Padel was officially recognised in 1991, when the International Padel
                    Federation was established in Madrid.
                    Padel is one of the most popular sports in Spain today.
                    It is the second biggest sport after football
                    The first professional padel tournament started in 2005
                    under the name Padel Pro Tour (PPT).

                    Each point starts with a serve. You have one first serve - if it fails, you have a
                    second serve.
                    The serve in padel must be underhand. The ball must bounce into the ground behind the
                    serve line
                    before hitting it with the racket. The server must have at least one foot in contact
                    with the
                    ground.
                    The server may only hit the ball at or below the waist.
                    The ball must land inside the opponent's service area diagonally. If the ball hits the
                    service area
                    and bounces on the glass walls the serve is good. If the ball hits the service area and
                    bounces on
                    the
                    metal fence the serve is out.
                    Responding to the opponent's serve
                    The ball must hit the serve area once before being returned.
                    You can also wait for the ball to hit the glass wall, as long as it does not hit the
                    ground twice.

                    When you hit the ball into the opponent’s court, the ball must first touch the ground,
                    then it can bounce off the glass walls or the fence. Once the ball has touched the
                    glass walls or the fence, the ball can no longer bounce on your ground again,
                    but you must hit it back into the opponent’s court.

                    The scoring system in padel is the same as in tennis: each game goes 15- 30- 40- advantages-
                    game
                    and you play the best of 3 sets of 6 games each.
                    In order to win a set you need to have a difference of at least 2 games (e.g. 6-4). If the
                    score
                    is 5-5 you play other 2 games to get to 7-5. If the score is 6-6 you play a 7 points
                    tie-break.
                    A point is scored when the ball:
                    – it's ‘out’: it hits the glass or fence directly without first bouncing on the ground.
                    – it bounces twice on the ground
                    – it goes into the net
                    – it’s not returned to the opponent’s court ( for example it goes out of court after a smash
                    and
                    it is not returned to the opponent’s court)
